# DiskKnife 🔪  
*A clean cut through partition management.*

DiskKnife is a sleek, menu-driven command-line partition management tool written in pure C 🧠⚙️  
Designed to be beginner-friendly yet powerful, it helps you list block devices, view disk usage, format partitions, and more — right from your terminal.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This tool is powerful. Use with caution. Always double-check before formatting or modifying real partitions!

## 💡 Features

- List block devices (via `lsblk`)
- Show disk usage (via `df`)
- Format partitions to:
  - `FAT32`
  - `ext4`
  - `NTFS`
- Create partition tables (MBR/GPT)
  
- Create and delete partitions
  
- Mount and unmount partitions safely
  
- **Burn Windows ISOs to USB (UEFI-only)**
    The Windows ISO burning feature:
    Splits the USB into FAT32 (for boot files) + NTFS (for big files like install.wim)
    Mounts the ISO using a loop device
    Copies everything using rsync, logs progress
    Installs the UEFI bootloader (bootx64.efi) to FAT32
   *Split-WIM compatible with dual FAT32+NTFS partitions!*

- Confirmation prompts to prevent mistakes
  
- Modular structure with clean, readable code

## 🧪 Safe Testing with Loop Devices

Avoid risking real drives. You can test on virtual block devices:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=1M count=100
losetup /dev/loop0 disk.img
```

Perfect for experimenting without frying your actual setup 🔥

## 🔮 Roadmap

- [x] NTFS support (`mkntfs` via `ntfs-3g`)
- [x] Partition table creation (MBR/GPT)
- [x] Basic partition creation
- [x] **🔥 Windows ISO burning** *(FAT32+NTFS dual partition, UEFI only)*
- [ ] Improved error handling/logging
- [ ] ISO burning UI enhancements
- [ ] Maybe a minimal GUI in the far future
